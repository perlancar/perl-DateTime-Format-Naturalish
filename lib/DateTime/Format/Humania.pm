# ABSTRACT: Parse human date/time

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use DateTime;
 use DateTime::Format::Humania;

 my $parser = DateTime::Format::Humania->new();
 my $dt = $parser->parse_datetime("2 hours 13 minutes from now");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are already some other DateTime human language parsers on CPAN, e.g.
L<DateTime::Format::Natural>. This module is yet another implementation of such,
designed to make it easy to add new human languages.

=head1 HOW IT WORKS

Parsing a date string is done by matching it against a bunch of patterns. Parsing
succeeds if there is at least one pattern matches. Parsing fails if no pattern
matches.

A pattern is basically a regex. You provide them in p_*() methods. Example:

 # in DateTime::Format::Humania::EN
 sub p_now       { { pattern => qr/(?:now)/ }

 # in DateTime::Format::Humania::ID
 sub p_yesterday { qr/(?:kemarin)/ }

When a pattern matches the text, an associated a_*() action method will be run.
For example:

 sub a_YESTERDAY { my ($self, $dt) = @_; $dt->add(days => -1) }

The action method will be given a DateTime object which was initially created
using DateTime->now().

A pattern can be composed of tokens and other patterns:

 # in EN
 sub p_LAST_WEEKDAY { "<LAST> <WEEKDAY>" }
 sub t_LAST { "last" }

 # in ID (in Indonesian, order is reversed, we usually say 'saturday next')
 sub p_NEXT_WEEKDAY { "<WEEKDAY> <NEXT>" }
 sub t_NEXT { ["berikutnya", "depan"] }

They will also be converted into a regex, e.g. in EN (note the named captures):

 qr/(?<NEXT>(?:last)) (?<WEEKDAY>(?:monday|mon|tuesday|tue|...))/

=head1 ADDING A NEW HUMAN LANGUAGE

To add a new language, subclass this module, which already contains many patterns
(though some might contain Englishisms). You usually then alter a few p_*()
methods, as well as provide some translations for some text (like weekday and
month names in t_*() methods). The point is that most of the action methods
should be reusable.

Of course you can add new patterns along with their actions, though try to think
more generically and see if your new pattern is also applicable to English/the
base class.

If you want to remove some patterns because it is not used in your language,
override the associated p_*() method and return undef.

For more details, view the source code to existing translations, like
L<DateTime::Format::Humania::ID>.
